# ChimpTestCheater
I made this for [humanbenchmark.com's chimpanzee test](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/chimp) to show that I am superior to apes.

The chimp test is a test of working memory and chimpanzees have consistently outperformed humans in it.
Unless humans are allowed to use tools :)


### Features
Currently it can automatically play stages with up to 30 numbers. This can be easily extended by simply adding pictures of the numbers to /Numbers/ folder.

### Usage
Specify the bounding box of game area to `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` variables and continue button coordinates to `continue_btn`.

If you want to see image of where it is going to click set `show` to `True`.

Run main.py and click enter when the test has started. If show mode is on, you need to press enter to confirm clicking. 

Press enter to run it again.
